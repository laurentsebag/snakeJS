# snakeJS

Small snake game project/exercise to teach programming



1. See [exercise.js](exercise.js) to learn how to use the canvas and draw a snake step by step.
2. [script.js](script.js) contains an implementation of the basic snake movement.
You can also use it together with [snake.js](snake.js) to help you progress with the game
once you understand how to draw on the canvas.
